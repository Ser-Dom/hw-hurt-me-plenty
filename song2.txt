Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, ooh!
Turn on I see red
Adrenaline crash and crash my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
One hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white knuckles tight
Through black and white
Oh, on I burn,
Fuel is pumping engines,
Burning hard, loose and clean
And I burn,
Turning my direction,
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire,
Hey
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah
Take the corner, going to crash,
Headlights (head-on), headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Yeah lives way too fast, fast, fast, oh-aye
Oh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Turning my direction?
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel gimme fire gimme that which I desire
Uh yeah yeah
White knuckle tight
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire
Oh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And then I burn, turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, oh!
On I burn
